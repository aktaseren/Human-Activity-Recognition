# Human-Activity-Recognition
Classification of Human Activities

The speed of development of technology has been increasing rapidly in all industries in especially the latest years
owing to the eagerness to make the life more intelligent and easier. This technological evolution has encouraged 
the wider usage of the Internet of Things (IoT) in whole industries. Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is one of the 
notable usage areas of IoT and allows a wide range of common computing applications by identifying the activity done 
by a user. These spectacular applications have been analysed, assessed and advanced to the point which various 
regularly available products have HAR systems integrated. This can be seen on some devices such as mobile phones, 
watches, sleep masks which have HAR systems integrated into the mobile applications of their producer. These 
applications record and analyse daily and sleep activities as a purpose.

This repository presents a means of understanding HAR from the data collected from the records of 30 subjects 
performing daily living activities (Walking, Walking_Upstairs, Walking_Downstairs, Sitting, Standing, Laying) while
moving a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors. In this thesis, the activity recognition task is 
decided as a classification problem. Na√Øve Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbours(KNN)
and Random Forest from Supervised Classification Algorithms in ML were used to perform the classification task as the 
main goal to get better predictive accuracy on the subject of the existing benchmark study applying Monte Carlo method. 
Additionally, comparison of split ratios of the dataset as train and test sets over performances of these algorithms 
by showing the graph was made. Split ratios were determined 60:40, 70:30, 80:20, and 90:10. The model with the highest
accuracy was observed as Linear SVM in the result of each different split ratio of the dataset.
